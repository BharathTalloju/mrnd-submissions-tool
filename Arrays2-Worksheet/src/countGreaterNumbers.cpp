/*
OVERVIEW: You are given a bank statement where transactions are ordered by date. Write a function that finds the number of transactions in that statement after a given date.
-- find the count of numbers greater than a given number in a sorted array.
E.g.: Input: A[3] = { { 10, "09-10-2003", "First" }, { 20, "19-10-2004", "Second" }, { 30, "03-03-2005", "Third" } };
date = "19-10-2004"
Output: 1 (only one transaction : { 30, "03-03-2005", "Third" })

INPUTS: Two bank statements (array of transactions).

OUTPUT: Combined statement ordered by transaction date.

ERROR CASES: Return NULL for invalid inputs.
